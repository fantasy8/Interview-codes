    <div class="item"><t1><span>26</span> SPOT HIDDEN WINDOWS</t1>
        <p>Sometimes programs display a message asking you to do something, but that message is
        under  another  window  and  you  don't  see  it.
        You're  waiting  for  the  program,  its  waiting
        for you, so nothing happens. The window is
        made  visible  after  200  seconds  but  you  can
        shorten  the  delay.  Launch  regedit  from  the
        Start  menu,  go  to
        HKEY_CURRENT_USER\
        Control  Panel  \Desktop,  double-click
        ForegroundLockTimeout  and  select
        Decimal.  Change  the  value  to  30,000
        miliseconds(30 seconds).</p>
        <t1><span>27</span> SAVE A REGISTRY KEY</t1>
        <p>Sometimes  a  change  to  a  registry  key  does
        not go as planed. It's quick and easy to return
        to the key you changed if you've saved it to
        Regedit's  editing  window.  Click  Add  to
        Favorites,  give  it  a  descriptive  name,  and
        tweak  away  knowing  that  changes  can  be
        undone in seconds.</p>

        <t1><span>41</span> SOLVE SLOW STARTS</t1>
        <p>If Windows 7 is taking a long time to launch,
        or shut down, the Event Viewer may tell you
        which  program  or  driver  is  responsible.
        Click  Start,  type  Eventvwr.msc,  and  press
        Return.  Expand  the  Applications  and
        Services  Logs  section  and  browse  to  the
        Microsoft\Windows\Diagnostic
        Performance\Operational.  Scroll  the  event
        list  on  your  PC  to  see  if  Windows  knows
        who to blame for your performance issues.</p>

    <div class="item">
        <t1><span>45</span> RESTORE RUN</t1>
        <p>If  you  miss  the  Windows  XP  Run  option
        which was used by many to launch programs
        quickly,  right-click  the  Start  orb,  select
        Properties->Customize,  check  the  Run
        Command  box,click  OK  and  a  Run  option
        should now appear on the Start menu.</p>
        <t1><span>46</span> LAUNCH APPLETS FAST</t1>
        <p>Don't  waste  time  browsing  to  the  Control
        Panel  for  the  right  tool  for  making  changes
        to  your  computer  when  you  can  launch  it
        directly.  To  run  Device  Manager,  for
        example,  click  Start,  type  Device  in  the
        search  box  and  Windows  should  display  a
        Device manager link for you. Windows also
        responds  to  vague  searches,  so  if  you  type
        partition,  the  disk  management  tool  will  be
        listed.</p>
        <t1><span>72</span> SPEED UP SEARCHES</t1>
        <p>Right-click  the  Start  button  and  select
        Properties. Click Customize, scroll down the
        list  of  available  options  and  select  "Search
        without  public  folders"  under  "Search  other
        files  and  libraries".  Click  OK  and  results
        should appear  much quicker  than before, as
        there  are  far  fewer  places  to  search.  Public
        folders  are  rarely  used  by  most  people  so
        axing them in search is a cost-free speed up
        trick.  which  was  used  by  many  to  launch
        programs  quickly,  right-click  the  Start  orb,
        select Properties->Customize, check the Run
        Command  box,click  OK  and  a  Run  option
        should now appear on the Start menu.</p>
